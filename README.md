# Data De-Identification using Symmetric Data (BoB 8)

## ABSTRACT

As data usage increases, the risk of personal information leakage is increasing. To reduce such risk, personal information must be used de-identified.

### ISO/IEC 20889

De-identification is the process used to prevent someone's personal identity from being revealed. For example, data produced during human subject research might be de-identified to preserve the privacy of research participants.

### Technique

#### Pseudonymization

- Pseudonymization
  - Heuristic pseudonymization
  - Encryption 
  - Swapping
- Aggregation
  - Aggregation
  - Micro Aggregation
  - Rounding
  - Rearrangement
- Data Reduction
  - Removing Identifier
  - Partical Removing Identifier
  - Reducing Records
- Data Suppression
  - Random Rounding
  - Data Range
  - Controlled Rounding
- Data Masking
  - Adding Random Noise
  - blank and impute

#### k-anonymization

- k-anonymization
- l-diversity
- t-closeness
- Differential Privacy

## Result

- data de-identification guide reports of each industry(medical, manufacturing, distribution etc.) 
- library for creating symmetric data
- library for data de-identification and re-identification in big data environments like hadoop and spark
